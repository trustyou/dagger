# dagger

Dagger performs tasks, providing you with parallel execution, and dependency resolution.

Workflows are defined as graphs (**d**irected **a**cyclic **g**raphs â€¦ get it?). You tell dagger to
run certain tasks, and it makes sure that dependencies are discovered and run in a correct order.

Tasks are run in a process pool of configurable size.

You define tasks by subclassing `Task`:

    class DoStuff(Task):

        def run(self):
            print("Look at me, I'm runniiiiiing ...")

Tasks accept two parameters during creation

* `config`: Something picklable to customize the tasks behavior at runtime
* `dependencies`: A list of `Task` instances that need to be done before we start this task

If task execution fails, a `DaggerException` is raised, with information about which tasks completed
and which failed. There is also a possibility to make Dagger resume execution of a failed task graphs
from the point of failure by assigning tasks unique ids:

`
run_tasks([awesome_task, very_awesome_task], resume_id = "awesome_tasks")
`
